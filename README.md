# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction App

A **Machine Learning web application** built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input data.  
This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.  
This project uses a **Logistic Regression model** (and other ML models tested) to predict whether a person has heart disease based on health-related parameters.
